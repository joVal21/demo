# Creating a Profile

## Purpose

Eventually my wife will be creating a website to share her skills with potential employers and it's important to me to be able to create something that she can use. 

## List of Objectives

1. Find the right photo
1. Utilize proper colors to make profile more welcoming
1. Figure out how to add a short "About-Me" section
1. Link her online resume via the contact button
1. Make the profile card able to flip on click to display more information
1. Add the Dominican Flag to the background of the profile. It should have a low opacity but high enough to be seen clearly
